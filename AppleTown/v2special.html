<strong style="color:black;font-size:20px;font-weight:bolder;">GoodBye DarkCraft.</strong>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0.5em;color:black;font-size:20px;font-weight:light;text-align:left;font-family:sans;">
 On other news, DarkCraft SMP that was hosted of the first original AppleTown, recently got discontinued by the Server owner, due to lack of funding for operations. We sadly didn't get the download link for the world, since the owner has discontinued the server early than the end date. R.I.P. DarkCraft SMP.

<strong style="color:black;font-size:20px;font-weight:bolder;">Discontinuing Operations in NessaSMP & AppleTown Ran Server (Server #3), SMPEarth AppleTown Server</strong>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0.5em;color:black;font-size:20px;font-weight:light;text-align:left;font-family:sans;">
We have decided to discontinue operations in the following servers, 'NessaSMP' 'AppleTown Server #3, Apple Town Official Server' 'SMPEarth.', We have decided to discontinue these servers from the Apple Town community effective ASAP. We have decided to focus on our main hub at the moment which is orchidia, also development for NessaSMP AppleTown has already been halted for 2-3 months now, we will be removing them on our server listings ASAP. SMPEarth on the other hand, well it has also been halted too, it is still up for discussion, but until we launch with more active members in the community we have decided not to build a town there.

<strong style="color:black;font-size:20px;font-weight:bolder;">Development for V.2</strong>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0.5em;color:black;font-size:20px;font-weight:light;text-align:left;font-family:sans;">
Development for V.2. for Apple Town will be coming soon, hopefully finished by the summer of 2021, if we get more members. Our plan is simple, to unlock and develop the 'unofficial stock / trading' area of the website, as well as unlocking the news feature on our website. Although right now you are seeing the AppleTown news on the webpage, this article is in 'archive' mode, so which basically means that this article is going to be archived with the same layout until the new website / area has been developed, archived news articles will be in a seperate area with the old styles in a catagory.
